# Global

International relations are marked by significant economic and diplomatic shifts. The IMF has warned of global economic uncertainty, while the BRICS nations are reportedly exploring a digital currency to challenge the U.S. dollar. Tensions between the U.S. and China persist, fueled by U.S. criticism of China's rare earth controls, proposed American tariffs, and an ongoing space race. In diplomacy, Venezuelan opposition leader Mar√≠a Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the UN is facing a funding crunch. Numerous bilateral meetings occurred, including visits by Singapore's Prime Minister to Australia and New Zealand, China's Foreign Minister to Europe, and a planned visit by Canada's Foreign Minister to India, signaling a complex web of shifting alliances.

*GPE*: The global system is defined by the structural conflict between the decaying US-led unipolar order and the ascendant multipolar world. The IMF's "warnings" and the UN's funding crisis are symptoms of a failing Western-centric financial architecture, while the BRICS' exploration of a digital currency is a direct material challenge to the dollar's use as a weapon of financial warfare. US-China tensions are not a dispute between equals but a full-spectrum hybrid war waged by the imperial core to contain its primary economic rival, using tariffs, military threats, and control over critical minerals. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to a US-backed Venezuelan opposition figure exposes the prize as a political instrument of empire, used to legitimize its regime-change objectives while ignoring anti-imperialist figures.

# China

China's economy shows mixed signals, with a post-pandemic travel surge during the Golden Week holiday that was not matched by strong consumer spending. Technologically, the nation demonstrated its capabilities by launching the Gravity-1 rocket from a sea platform and developing underwater data centers. On the geopolitical front, Beijing has been assertive, criticizing Taiwan's President-elect William Lai, issuing bounties for Taiwanese individuals, and releasing footage of a collision with a Philippine vessel. The country also hosted a global conference on women's issues and is strengthening ties in Africa through initiatives like health education and technology hubs.

*GPE*: China's actions are not "assertiveness" but calculated moves within its long-term socialist development strategy, which directly challenges the US-led imperial order. Technological achievements like the Gravity-1 rocket and underwater data centers demonstrate a drive for sovereign industrial capacity, insulating it from Western pressure. The control over rare earths is a direct countermeasure against US economic warfare. China's strengthening of ties with Africa and its leadership in forums like the SCO are material expressions of building a multipolar world based on South-South cooperation, contrasting sharply with the West's neocolonial model. Mainstream narratives of "mixed economic signals" deliberately obscure the resilience of a state-led economy focused on real production and infrastructure, not the speculative metrics prioritized by Western finance capital.

# East Asia

In Japan, Sanae Takaichi is set to become the country's first female prime minister, a move that prompted the Komeito party to exit the ruling coalition. The country was also hit by Typhoon Halong. North Korea has been highly active, celebrating the 80th anniversary of its ruling party with military parades that showcased new ICBMs, including the Hwasong-20. Pyongyang hosted high-level talks with officials from China and Russia. In Taiwan, the government unveiled its new "T-Dome" air defense system and conducted missile tests in response to what it describes as China's "gray-zone" warfare and cognitive warfare campaigns. South Korea is observing social shifts, including a boom in solo dining and a surge in international students.

*GPE*: The region is a primary theater for the US imperial containment strategy against China. Taiwan's unveiling of the "T-Dome" system is not a sovereign defense act but an escalation orchestrated by Washington, which uses the island as a disposable pawn to provoke the mainland. The narrative of Chinese "gray-zone warfare" is propaganda designed to obscure the US role in fueling separatist illusions and militarizing the region. North Korea's military displays and high-level talks with Russia and China are a direct response to this encirclement, consolidating an anti-imperialist security bloc. Japan's political shifts occur within its fixed position as a subordinate state in the US security architecture, a legacy of its post-WWII occupation.

# Singapore

Singapore is focusing on economic resilience and international diplomacy. The nation's currency has strengthened, and DBS bank hit a significant market capitalization milestone, though overall wage growth has stalled. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong conducted a diplomatic tour of Australia and New Zealand, upgrading ties and signing a crisis trade deal. Domestically, the government is enhancing public infrastructure, such as speeding up MRT defect detection, and bolstering social programs, including a new psychological center to promote mental health resilience. Singapore has also stated its readiness to assist in the future rebuilding of Gaza.

*GPE*: Singapore‚Äôs foreign policy is a direct material expression of its official playbook, which uses "Principled Pragmatism" as the ideological justification for securing its position as a hub of global capital within the fracturing unipolar order. Its strategy of "Omnidirectional Engagement" is not a neutral stance but a calculated balancing act, managing its deep economic integration with China while maintaining its security subordination to the US imperial core and its regional allies (Australia, New Zealand), a duality demonstrated by simultaneous high-level forums with both powers. Domestically, the state's focus on "resilience" and "social cohesion" is a direct response to the internal contradictions of its capitalist model, where the official goal of "inclusive growth" is undermined by the reality of stalled wages for the working class, even as corporate and state reserves accumulate. The stated readiness to "rebuild Gaza" exemplifies its strategy to act as a "facilitator" and "problem-solver" to maximize its relevance, but it is a careful diplomatic maneuver that avoids taking a truly "principled stand" against the root cause‚Äîthe US-backed Israeli genocide‚Äîthereby ensuring it does not challenge the imperial system it ultimately depends on for security.

# Southeast Asia

The region has faced significant natural disasters and political tensions. The Philippines was struck by a powerful earthquake and subsequent aftershocks in Mindanao, causing multiple fatalities and tsunami warnings. Tensions between the Philippines and China also escalated after a Chinese coast guard vessel damaged a Philippine ship. In Myanmar, the military junta's violence continues, with reports of it bombing a village festival and killing dozens of civilians in a separate attack. Elsewhere, Indonesia is grappling with demands for youth employment, Vietnam's capital Hanoi has suffered from repeated severe flooding, and a kidnapping surge in Cambodia is reportedly affecting Korean nationals.

*GPE*: The region is a key battleground in the US hybrid war against China. The escalating Philippines-China maritime tensions are not isolated incidents but are actively fomented by Washington to disrupt China's regional economic integration and manufacture consent for an increased US military presence. The framing of the conflict as Chinese aggression serves to obscure this imperial strategy. Internal crises, such as youth unemployment in Indonesia and violence in Myanmar, are exacerbated by the pressures of neocolonial exploitation, creating conditions that both imperial and anti-imperialist powers seek to influence. The discussion of Indonesia's potential BRICS membership highlights the region's struggle to chart a sovereign path amidst these great power dynamics.

# South Asia

Border tensions and natural disasters have marked recent events in the region. Fierce fighting and alleged cross-border strikes have escalated tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, deadly landslides and floods have impacted both India and Nepal, causing numerous deaths and stranding hikers on Mount Everest. On the diplomatic and economic front, direct flights between India and China have resumed, and UK business leaders visited Mumbai to strengthen trade ties with India. In Bangladesh, the return of political figure Tarique Rahman has been a notable event.

*GPE*: The region is a site of complex contradictions where the material interests of Eurasian integration are challenging historical tensions. The resumption of India-China flights and India's pivotal role in BRICS signify a gravitation toward the multipolar order, even as border disputes persist. The UK's trade visit is an attempt by a declining imperial power to secure market access, while the US is increasingly sidelined in regional security, evidenced by the joint rejection of a US return to Afghanistan. The warning that AI could disrupt India's service-based growth model highlights the vulnerabilities of economies dependent on the imperial core, pushing nations toward industrial sovereignty and partnerships within the BRICS framework.

# Central Asia

The region is advancing its technological infrastructure and diplomatic engagements. Kazakhstan launched Central Asia's most powerful supercomputer and hosted the "Digital Bridge 2025" forum, emphasizing AI's role in education. In Tajikistan, President Emomali Rakhmon hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit and bilateral talks. Kyrgyzstan is in the process of holding parliamentary elections while also undertaking significant urban renewal projects in its capital, Bishkek.

*GPE*: Central Asia is actively pivoting toward the Eurasian-led multipolar order, breaking free from its peripheral role in the unipolar system. Kazakhstan's development of sovereign technological infrastructure, such as its new supercomputer, is a material move to reduce dependency on Western tech monopolies. The high-level summit in Tajikistan attended by President Putin signifies the region's deepening integration into security and economic blocs like the SCO and EAEU, which are explicitly designed as alternatives to US-dominated institutions and serve to construct a sovereign, interconnected Eurasian heartland outside of imperial control.

# Russia

Russia's primary focus remains its ongoing war with Ukraine, marked by continued Russian attacks and Ukrainian strikes on Russian power infrastructure. On the diplomatic stage, President Putin has been active, meeting with the leader of Azerbaijan and attending a summit in Tajikistan with other regional leaders. He also signaled a readiness to engage in talks over the New START treaty with the United States. Additionally, Russia's Security Council Secretary, Nikolai Patrushev's subordinate, Dmitry Medvedev, visited North Korea, reinforcing ties between the two nations.

*GPE*: Russia's actions are a direct military and economic response to decades of NATO expansion, an instrument of US imperial policy designed to encircle and subordinate Eurasia. The war in Ukraine is the kinetic flashpoint in the global conflict between the unipolar hegemon and the emerging multipolar world. Russia's "Pivot to Eurasia," exemplified by projects like the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline and reinforced ties with North Korea, represents a fundamental reorientation of its economy away from the West and toward integration with China and the Global South. This move accelerates de-dollarization and systematically undermines the material basis of US global power.

# West Asia (Middle East)

A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has largely taken effect, following a diplomatic push involving Egypt and the United States. Displaced Palestinians have begun returning to their homes in Gaza, facing widespread destruction and a severe humanitarian crisis. Despite the truce, reports of some continued Israeli strikes persist, and the Israeli military has hit targets in Lebanon. The Israeli Defense Forces have withdrawn from some areas in Gaza. Elsewhere, Iran has rejected the idea of new nuclear talks with the EU, and there are calls for increased dialogue between Azerbaijan and Armenia to resolve their conflict.

*GPE*: The events in West Asia are the brutal manifestation of a US-backed settler-colonial project designed to maintain imperial hegemony. The "fragile ceasefire" is not a step toward peace but a strategic pause in a two-year genocide, forced by the military and political costs inflicted by the Palestinian resistance. The widespread destruction in Gaza is a deliberate policy of de-development and ethnic cleansing. Narratives of "peace plans" from US political figures are propaganda designed to enforce Palestinian capitulation and legitimize the colonization project. The growing global rebellion against the US-Israel axis, from mass protests to the actions of the Gaza flotilla, reveals a widening crack in the imperial system's ability to control the narrative and enforce its will.

# Africa

The continent is experiencing a range of political, economic, and social challenges. Political instability is acute in several nations, with Madagascar facing deepening anti-government protests, Sudan's ongoing war seeing mixed reactions to a peace roadmap, and Mozambique battling extremist violence. In West Africa, Cameroon held elections amid hardship and security fears, while Burkina Faso arrested international NGO staff for alleged spying. Economically, many nations are grappling with soaring costs, with South Africa declaring an economic emergency and Nigeria postponing a petrol levy. On a continental level, leaders of the COMESA trade bloc are working to boost intra-African trade, and FOCAC is strengthening China-Africa ties.

*GPE*: Africa is a central arena for the struggle between neocolonial exploitation and sovereign development. The political instability and economic crises across the continent are not merely domestic failures but are the direct result of a system of imperial extraction, where institutions like the IMF enforce policies that facilitate the looting of resources. The "debt trap" narrative is propaganda used to discredit China's alternative development financing, which, as the Kenyan case shows, offers a path away from Western-imposed dependency. The strengthening of FOCAC and intra-African trade blocs represents a material effort to break from this neocolonial structure and build South-South cooperation, a trend the imperial core actively seeks to disrupt through hybrid warfare.

# Europe

The war in Ukraine remains a central issue, with the EU and NATO focused on providing defense and financial support to Kyiv. Internally, France is navigating a political crisis that saw President Macron reappoint his prime minister to avoid snap elections. The EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, survived no-confidence votes in the European Parliament. In the UK, Scottish leaders have called for a pause on asylum arrivals, and London saw large protests in support of Palestinians. Tensions were also noted in the Balkans, where Kosovo's Serbian minority expressed concerns over upcoming elections.

*GPE*: Europe is experiencing the severe internal contradictions of its role as a subordinate partner in the US imperial project. By sacrificing its economic interests to fuel the US proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, the continent is facing deindustrialization, energy crises, and political instability, as seen in France. The focus on funding the war while domestic populations face austerity reveals the priorities of a ruling class captured by US interests. The massive pro-Palestine protests in cities like London demonstrate a growing disconnect between the populace and a political establishment that remains complicit in the US-backed genocide in Gaza, exposing the democratic deficit at the core of these states.

# Latin America & Caribbean

Political turmoil has been a key theme in the region. In Peru, President Dina Boluarte was ousted by Congress. Venezuela conducted military drills in response to perceived U.S. threats and sought a UN meeting over the matter, while the U.S. reportedly halted talks with the Venezuelan government. Elsewhere, Cuba denounced U.S. threats, Brazil's government protested media coverage of the Gaza conflict, and the president of Ecuador's convoy was attacked. The region also faced natural disasters, with extreme rainfall and flooding causing deaths in Mexico.

*GPE*: The region remains a primary target for US imperial intervention, as dictated by the Monroe Doctrine. The political turmoil in Peru and the attack in Ecuador are characteristic of the instability fomented by Washington to crush sovereign political projects and secure access to resources. The hybrid war against Venezuela continues, with military threats and the weaponization of international awards to legitimize a US-backed opposition. This neocolonial control is being directly challenged by the growing economic influence of China, which offers an alternative to the debt peonage of US-controlled financial institutions, representing a material shift in the region's geopolitical alignment.

# North America

In the United States, domestic issues include a deadly explosion at a Tennessee explosives plant, a federal government shutdown impacting air travel, and ongoing political tensions. Former President Trump has been a central figure in foreign policy discussions, particularly regarding the Gaza ceasefire plan. President Biden confirmed he is receiving cancer therapy. Economically, the Federal Reserve is facing turmoil, and Wall Street has seen sharp drops. In other news, a helicopter crash in California injured several people, and veteran actress Diane Keaton passed away at 79.

*GPE*: The United States, the core of the global imperial system, is exhibiting advanced internal decay. The government shutdown, Federal Reserve turmoil, and collapsing infrastructure are the direct consequence of a political economy that prioritizes funding endless foreign wars and financial speculation over the material well-being of its own population. This is a core contradiction of empire. The narrative of a strong economy is a financial illusion masking widespread precarity, while the nation's critical dependence on Chinese rare earths for its own military-industrial complex exposes the material weakness underlying its aggressive and failing foreign policy.

# Oceania

In New Zealand, the new government's finance minister has been outlining economic policy, while a haka performed in Parliament caused a temporary halt to proceedings. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong of Singapore's visit, which included a traditional haka welcome, strengthened ties with both New Zealand and Australia. In Australia, a shooting incident caused chaos in Sydney, and in a lighter moment, a family of ducks brought traffic on a busy highway to a standstill.

*GPE*: Oceania's geopolitical alignment is being solidified as a key component of the US "Indo-Pacific" strategy to contain China. The diplomatic visits and upgraded "Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships" between Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand are not routine diplomacy but the material strengthening of a regional anti-China military and economic bloc. These nations function as southern anchors of the imperial system, integrating their security and economic policies to serve the broader US objective of maintaining unipolar dominance in the Pacific.
