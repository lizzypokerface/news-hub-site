# Global

*Overview (AI)*: Multiple sources reported that the United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. In US-China relations, progress was noted on a deal concerning TikTok, with President Trump and President Xi discussing the matter via phone call. The US also delayed a potential ban on the platform. Broader trade talks between the US and China were held in Madrid and discussed at the WTO. The European Union now perceives Russia as a more significant danger, while former President Trump has threatened new sanctions against Russia. The EU is also accelerating its phase-out of Russian energy. A technology deal was signed between the US and the UK. In other diplomatic news, the 22nd China-ASEAN Expo opened, with reports of surging trade and cooperation on AI between the two. China is also championing partnerships with Latin America and strengthening cultural ties with the Arab League and Egypt. Taiwan and Canada jointly called for Taiwan's inclusion in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

*Analysis(AI)*: The current global landscape is defined by the intensifying conflict between the decaying US-led unipolar system and the emergent anti-imperialist, multipolar order championed by nations like China, Russia, and the broader BRICS+ alliance. [[1]](https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/05/11/2024/brics-mounting-challenge-us-led-world-order-whom)[[2]](https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-winter-2024--issue-no-25/brics-and-the--multipolar-world) The US exercises its waning hegemony through aggressive unilateral actions, such as vetoing UN ceasefire resolutions for its client state, Israel, thereby demonstrating its role as a direct accomplice in genocide and its contempt for international law. [[3]](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2542486/middle-east)[[4]](https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/rights-lawyers-release-legal-analysis-us-complicity-israel-s) Simultaneously, it wages economic warfare against its primary competitor, China, through coercive negotiations over platforms like TikTok, which are not about "deals" but about containing a technological rival and maintaining financial dominance. [[5]](https://geopoliticaleconomy.org/u-s-economic-warfare-and-likely-foreign-defenses/) In opposition, nations are increasingly choosing multilateralism, building alternative institutions like the SCO and BRICS, and pursuing de-dollarization to escape the weaponized US financial system and achieve sovereign development.

# China

*Overview (AI)*: Domestically, China is focusing on developing its AI capabilities, with Huawei challenging Nvidia's dominance in the sector. The country is also dealing with a sluggish economy and high youth unemployment. Beijing hosted the Xiangshan Forum, where it asserted its influence, challenged the 'rules-based order,' and called for global unity and civilizational dialogue. The government is promoting green energy and tourism in Xinjiang, where a Belt and Road railway is also being upgraded. A film depicting Japanese germ warfare during WWII premiered, drawing criticism of Japan's invasion history. In Hong Kong, a WWII-era bomb was defused, and the city's annual policy address was delivered.

*Analysis(AI)*: China is systematically constructing a sovereign alternative to the US-led imperialist system, focusing on material and technological self-sufficiency as a defense against economic warfare. The drive to develop domestic AI capabilities, exemplified by Huawei's challenge to Nvidia, is a direct response to US attempts to stifle China's technological advancement through sanctions and microchip bans. Beijing's diplomatic initiatives, such as the Xiangshan Forum and strengthening ties with ASEAN, Latin America, and the Arab world, are practical steps to build a multipolar world based on its Global Security Initiative (GSI), which explicitly counters the coercive, US-centric "rules-based order." [[6]](https://rsisinternational.org/journals/ijriss/articles/chinas-global-security-initiative-and-global-development-initiative-a-challenge-to-the-us-led-global-order/)[[8]](https://en.icc.org.cn/thinktank_theories/policy_research/369.html) Domestically, the promotion of green development in Xinjiang and the commemoration of its WWII history serve to rebut Western propaganda narratives, which are themselves tools of hybrid warfare designed to destabilize the country and undermine its anti-imperialist project.

# East Asia

*Overview (AI)*: Taiwan showcased its homegrown weapons at a defense expo, emphasizing a push for self-reliance after the US reportedly halted military aid. In contrast, arms dealers were reported to be active in Taiwan. In Japan, defense technology is being upgraded. South Korea is dealing with domestic political controversy over official appointments and is considering a new visa bill that could impose high fees on financial firms. Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was seen inspecting military exercises, and discussions about his succession have been noted.

*Analysis(AI)*: The region is a primary front in the US's strategy to contain China, with Washington using regional states as subordinate proxies. Taiwan's showcase of "homegrown" weapons, framed as a move toward "self-reliance," is in reality a symptom of its precarious position as a pawn whose imperial patron is increasingly seen as unreliable. The push for defense upgrades in Japan serves to integrate it further into the US military-industrial complex's regional posture against China. Meanwhile, South Korea's trade disputes and pressures from the US reveal the exploitative, neocolonial nature of these alliances, where the economic interests of the subordinate state are sacrificed to serve the hegemon's geopolitical goals.

# Singapore

*Overview (AI)*: Singapore is focusing on maintaining neutrality amid US-China tensions, with officials like Chan Chun Sing visiting China. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and other ministers attended several domestic events, including anniversaries for student care organizations and the opening of the SIT Punggol Campus, promoting themes of lifelong learning. The city-state is also addressing practical issues such as coastal protection projects and disruptions on the SMRT train system.

*Analysis(AI)*: Singapore's diplomatic maneuvering, including official visits to China while maintaining ties with the US, represents a calculated strategy by an indispensable global hub to navigate growing great power competition. Its stated policy is not one of "neutrality," but of being "principled, not aligned," a pragmatic approach that prioritizes its own long-term national interests in a world with a re-emerging China. This balancing act acknowledges its deep integration into the global financial system and its long-standing security relationship with the U.S., which it views as a historic provider of regional security. Rather than being constrained, the goal is to be a friend to both but a proxy to none, building "overlapping circles of friends" with other key powers to maintain strategic depth and ensure its sovereignty. The domestic focus on "lifelong learning" and economic restructuring is a core part of this strategy, reflecting the principle that "Strength at Home is the Foundation" and ensuring its workforce remains indispensable in a global economy no longer exclusively dominated by the West.

# Southeast Asia

*Overview (AI)*: In the Philippines, climate threats and the concerns of fishermen were prominent issues, while a major fire in Manila displaced numerous residents. Thailand's king approved a new cabinet. In Indonesia, gig economy workers held protests. A border clash was reported in the region, though the specific countries were not named. In Malaysia, actress Michelle Yeoh was reported to be filming in Penang.

*Analysis(AI)*: Events in Southeast Asia expose the material consequences of neocolonial exploitation and the inherent contradictions of global capitalism. Protests by gig economy workers in Indonesia are a direct reaction to the hyper-precarity of labor under a system designed to maximize profit for transnational capital at the expense of workers' rights and protections. In the Philippines, the prominence of climate threats is a stark reminder of the environmental debt owed by the imperial core, whose industrial development has disproportionately fueled a crisis now borne by the Global South. These social and environmental strains are not isolated incidents but systemic features of a world order that prioritizes extraction and exploitation over human and ecological well-being.

# South Asia

*Overview(AI)*: In Nepal, the prime minister has vowed to fight corruption, following youth protests that led to a change in government. India is focusing on its self-reliance initiatives, particularly in Gujarat, while also facing trade tensions with the US over Russian oil tariffs. Severe weather, including cloudbursts, hit the state of Uttarakhand, prompting rescue operations. In Pakistan, the government is reportedly investing in donkeys for transport and has backtracked on a potential nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia. In Afghanistan, a British couple and other elderly prisoners held by the Taliban were released.

*Analysis(AI)*: The region is a key arena of resistance against US hegemony, where hybrid warfare campaigns clash with moves toward strategic autonomy. The youth protests and subsequent change in government in Nepal, framed in the mainstream as a pro-democracy movement, are identified by critical analysis as a US-orchestrated "regime change" operation to dislodge a government perceived as too friendly to China. [[9]](https://www.commonspace.eu/commentary/commentary-navigating-hybrid-threats-south-caucasus)[[10]](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/hybrid-warfare-africa-beware) In contrast, India's continued purchase of Russian oil despite US tariff threats demonstrates a calculated pursuit of its own material interests and a refusal to fully subordinate itself to Washington's financial warfare dictates. The reported Pakistan-Saudi nuclear and defense agreement is a significant anti-imperialist development, creating a new security bloc in West Asia to counter US-Israeli dominance and establish a sovereign defense posture outside of Western control.

# Central Asia

*Overview(AI)*: Kazakhstan has been active on the international and domestic front, announcing a digital nomad residency program and hosting a religious congress and boxing championships. The country is also pursuing a hydrogen energy path with the EU, advancing its nuclear test ban treaty goals, and planning the construction of new nuclear power plants. Trade with Pakistan is also being boosted. In Kyrgyzstan, discussions are underway to rename the city of Jalal-Abad to Manas, and preparations for early elections have begun.

*Analysis(AI)*: Kazakhstan's activities exemplify the multi-vector foreign policy that nations in the Global South are increasingly adopting to secure sovereign development in a multipolar world. By simultaneously pursuing a digital nomad program, advancing energy partnerships with the EU, upgrading Belt and Road infrastructure with China, and boosting trade with Pakistan, Kazakhstan is leveraging its strategic location to maximize its autonomy. This strategy is a form of resistance against the unipolar demand to "choose sides," instead building a web of economic and political relationships that prevents dependency on any single imperial power and strengthens its own national interests.

# Russia

*Overview(AI)*: Russia continues to be a focus of international attention, with President Putin reportedly showing no interest in a peace deal with Ukraine and attending military exercises. Russian forces conducted submarine drills and launched attacks on Ukrainian cities like Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. Russian jets also breached Estonian airspace, putting NATO on alert. Reports also emerged of Russians being recruited for spying activities in the UK.

*Analysis(AI)*: Russia is engaged in a direct military conflict with the US-led imperialist bloc on the battleground of Ukraine. Russian military actions, including drills and strikes, are a response to decades of NATO expansion, which serves as the military instrument of US unipolar dominance. The conflict is a proxy war, with the West using Ukraine as an instrument to try and weaken a key pole in the emerging multipolar world. [[11]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/alq/rufejo/rfej_2022_12_7-17.html) President Putin's reported disinterest in a "peace deal" reflects an understanding that any such deal on Western terms would mean capitulation to imperial expansion. The breach of Estonian airspace and recruitment of spies are manifestations of the low-intensity, attritional conflict that defines the struggle between the declining hegemon and a resurgent sovereign power.

# West Asia (Middle East)

*Overview(AI)*: The conflict in Gaza has intensified, with Israel conducting strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, leading to a rising Palestinian death toll and forced evacuations. Displaced Palestinians have been fleeing towards the sea, and Israeli forces have also demolished homes in the Negev and raided the West Bank. The situation has drawn widespread international condemnation, with UNICEF, the Pope, and Amnesty International speaking out. Aid efforts are underway from Palestinian-led groups and the Global Sumud Flotilla. Tensions in the wider region are high, with a Houthi drone crashing in Eilat, Israel, and Turkish President Erdogan issuing a warning to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.

*Analysis(AI)*: The region is the site of a blatant, US-backed genocide in Gaza, which serves as a raw exhibition of the imperialist system's core logic. [[4]](https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/rights-lawyers-release-legal-analysis-us-complicity-israel-s)[[12]](https://www.dawn.com/news/1864024) The US veto of the UN ceasefire resolution is not a policy failure but a deliberate act of complicity, using international bodies to shield its settler-colonial client state, Israel, as it carries out mass slaughter and ethnic cleansing. [[3]](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2542486/middle-east)[[13]](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/amnesty-international-warns-of-u-s-complicity-in-war-crimes-in-gaza/) The narrative of a "conflict" is propaganda designed to obscure the material reality of a heavily armed colonial power attempting to liquidate an indigenous population to secure land and resources. The expansion of Israeli strikes into Lebanon and the Houthi response are indicators of a widening regional confrontation against US-Israeli imperial aggression. The condemnation from global figures and aid efforts from flotillas represent a grassroots anti-imperialist response to the barbarism of the decaying unipolar order.

# Africa

*Overview(AI)*: Political and social issues are prevalent across the continent. Malawi held an election with results delayed, while Guinea is planning a constitutional referendum. In Nigeria, various political and social issues have arisen, including disputes in the Rivers State Assembly, protests by civil servants in Delta state, and security concerns in Anambra. A drone strike on a mosque in Sudan killed dozens, and separatist unrest in Cameroon is threatening schools. In Ethiopia, the modernization of Addis Ababa has led to resident displacement. Several nations are embracing technology, with Niger developing pesticide-spraying drones and South Africa and Cape Town using AI to combat air pollution and boost tourism. Diplomatic activities include a meeting between the leaders of South Africa and DR Congo, strengthened China-Morocco ties, and France halting counter-terrorism cooperation with Mali.

*Analysis(AI)*: Africa is a central theater of anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggle, where the waning influence of old European powers is being replaced by a contest between US neocolonialism and China's model of South-South cooperation. [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_military_withdrawal_from_West_Africa_(2022%E2%80%93present))[[15]](https://www.abqinternational.org/colonialism-neo-colonialism-france-and-china/) France's forced halt of "counter-terrorism" cooperation in Mali signifies the collapse of its Fran√ßafrique sphere of influence, driven by popular rejection of its military and economic domination. [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_military_withdrawal_from_West_Africa_(2022%E2%80%93present)) Conversely, strengthening China-Morocco ties and China's growing security influence are framed as an alternative development path, free from the political conditionalities and debt peonage of Western institutions. [[16]](https://journalonworldaffairs.org/2021/03/03/addressing-chinas-and-frances-encroachment-in-africa-requires-a-new-perspective-on-neocolonialism/)[[17]](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/112880/1/MPRA_paper_112880.pdf) Internal political disputes, protests, and displacement in countries like Nigeria and Ethiopia are often rooted in the material legacy of colonial borders and the ongoing extraction of resources by foreign capital, which perpetuates instability for profit.

# Europe

*Overview(AI)*: Former US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK was a major event, involving meetings with the royal family and UK opposition leader Keir Starmer. In France, workers went on strike to protest budget cuts, and President Macron toured the restored Notre-Dame cathedral. Germany saw gains for far-right parties in elections and a criminal complaint filed against the government for its support of Israel. Elsewhere, pro-government rallies took place in Serbia, and anti-Euro protests occurred in Bulgaria. The conflict in Ukraine remains a key issue, with the EU phasing out Russian energy and Poland receiving drone defense training from Ukraine.

*Analysis(AI)*: Europe is experiencing the severe internal contradictions and economic blowback of its subordination to the US imperial project. [[11]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/alq/rufejo/rfej_2022_12_7-17.html) Widespread strikes in France against budget cuts and the rise of far-right parties in Germany are direct symptoms of the domestic decay caused by prioritizing funding for the US proxy war in Ukraine over social welfare. The EU's phasing out of Russian energy, dictated by Washington, is an act of economic self-immolation that benefits US energy exporters while deindustrializing the European core, a dynamic aptly described as "Stockholm Syndrome." [[11]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/alq/rufejo/rfej_2022_12_7-17.html)[[18]](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12092) The criminal complaint in Germany over its complicity in the Gaza genocide and protests against Trump's visit reveal a growing popular consciousness of the moral and material bankruptcy of aligning with the US-led imperial order.

# Latin America & Caribbean

*Overview(AI)*: Venezuela has been active militarily, conducting drills in the Caribbean and criticizing the US naval posture, reportedly in response to tensions with the US. The country also hosted a technology fair in Caracas. Elsewhere, Ecuador imposed a curfew, Panama is facing high debt, and Argentina is negotiating a loan. In Colombia, former military members were sentenced for extrajudicial killings. Mexico's new president is resetting trade ties and also training Haitian soldiers.

*Analysis(AI)*: The region continues to be a primary target of US imperial control under the revived Monroe Doctrine, which seeks to crush any move toward sovereign development and subordinate the hemisphere's economies to US material interests. [[19]](https://www.e-ir.info/2025/04/08/monroe-reinterpreted-trump-2-0s-contemporary-approach-to-latin-america/)[[20]](https://mronline.org/2025/09/03/the-restoration-of-the-monroe-doctrine-and-trumps-imperialist-offensive-in-latin-america/) Venezuela's military exercises are a direct act of anti-imperialist defiance against US naval posturing and financial warfare. [[20]](https://mronline.org/2025/09/03/the-restoration-of-the-monroe-doctrine-and-trumps-imperialist-offensive-in-latin-america/) Mexico's efforts to reset trade ties and Argentina's loan negotiations highlight the two paths available: a struggle for autonomy versus entrapment in neocolonial debt peonage to US-controlled financial institutions like the IMF. Colombia's sentencing of military members for extrajudicial killings reveals the brutal internal security structures often backed by the US to suppress popular movements and protect the interests of transnational capital.

# North America

*Overview(AI)*: In the United States, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, a move expected to impact Asian markets. Former President Trump remains a prominent figure, visiting Washington after his UK trip, signing executive orders, and proposing new "gold and platinum" visas for residency while increasing H-1B visa fees. The government is also dealing with issues like migrant crossings and arrests by ICE in Chicago. Natural events included the eruption of the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii and a mudslide in California.

*Analysis(AI)*: The United States, the imperial core, is exhibiting advanced symptoms of systemic decay, where the financial and military costs of maintaining global dominance are fueling a domestic crisis of stagflation, social breakdown, and political illegitimacy. [[21]](https://firebrand.red/2025/07/trumpism-a-morbid-symptom-of-declining-empire/)[[22]](https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/three-signs-your-empire-is-collapsing-9441214f85f9) The Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is not a neutral policy tool but an attempt to manage the economic blowback of imperial overreach and spiraling debt.
