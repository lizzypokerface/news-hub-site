`CATCH-UP ISSUE`

# Global

International relations are marked by significant diplomatic and economic shifts. The US-China rivalry continues, with China reportedly ending US technological leverage and pushing de-dollarization efforts alongside Russia. Tensions are also evident in trade, with Europe suffering in a trade war, and China pushing back against EU moves targeting Huawei. Multiple high-level meetings occurred, including a C5+1 summit where Kazakhstan's potential entry into the Abraham Accords was a key development, a CELAC-EU summit, and a G7 summit in Canada. Leaders from Kazakhstan, Hungary, and Syria met with former US President Trump, who also discussed a potential pardon for Israeli PM Netanyahu. Other bilateral developments include Taiwan deepening ties with the EU, an Australia-Indonesia security treaty, resumed India-China flights, and strained US-UK relations. The COP30 climate summit in Brazil was a major focus, though it was marked by protests and questions over the US's absence. In finance, a Chinese national known as the 'crypto queen' was jailed in the UK for a massive Bitcoin fraud.

# China

China is advancing its technological and military capabilities, showcasing new fighter jet technology, a dancing robot, humanoid robots, and a biodegradable cornea. The nation's space program is also active, with astronauts in its space station and progress in space science. The new Fujian aircraft carrier has entered service, and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is enhancing regional integration. Domestically, the country is dealing with deflationary pressures and infrastructure incidents, including two separate bridge collapses in Sichuan. China hosted the CIIE trade expo to support global trade and is seeing its film industry lead the global box office. Socially, matchmaking agencies are helping young men find partners, and Hong Kong is working to attract more global students.

# East Asia

Regional security and domestic issues dominate headlines. Japan is holding defense symposiums, militarizing its bear control measures amid a rise in encounters, and its researchers are mapping glacier melt. In South Korea, the USS George Washington's visit to Busan highlights military cooperation with the US, while the country grapples with issues like leniency for DUI offenses, youth gambling, and a power plant collapse that killed five. The K-pop industry continues its global ascent with Grammy recognition and a major win for T1 in the League of Legends championship. Taiwan was hit by Typhoon Fung-wong, leading to evacuations and flooding, but also saw its tech giant TSMC post record revenue and deepened ties with the EU. North Korean hackers are reportedly targeting individuals' personal lives.

# Singapore

The Singaporean government is active on multiple fronts, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong hosting his Thai counterpart to sign an MOU and launching a new Communicable Diseases Agency. Domestically, a new Online Safety Bill was passed, and public debates are ongoing regarding vaping, the preservation of 38 Oxley Road, and political integrity. The economy shows mixed signals, with Singtel reporting a 14% rise in net profit and OCBC bank beating expectations, while some businesses face a tough market. The city-state is also focused on social issues, including neurodivergence and the pressures on social workers. In public safety, incidents included a ferry collision, a fire in Yishun, and a murder case on Chin Swee Road. Singapore also conducted joint military exercises with the US Army.

# Southeast Asia

The region is grappling with severe weather, as Typhoon Fung-wong devastated the Philippines, killing at least 25 and forcing over a million to evacuate, while Typhoon Kalmaegi hit Vietnam. The Rohingya refugee crisis continues, with a boat capsizing near Malaysia, resulting in 21 deaths and prompting search efforts. Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have led to the suspension of a peace deal. In Indonesia, a school explosion in Jakarta hospitalized dozens, and the government is expanding wind farms for renewable energy. Other domestic events include a food poisoning incident in a free meal program in Indonesia, a crackdown on artists in Myanmar, and the Malaysian rapper Namewee surrendering to police over an influencer's death. Economically, the region is seeking climate finance, and Timor-Leste is boosting growth through infrastructure projects.

# South Asia

Security concerns are paramount across South Asia, with multiple deadly attacks. A car bomb in New Delhi killed at least 12 people, prompting Indian Prime Minister Modi to vow justice and launch a major investigation into potential terror links. In Pakistan, a suicide bombing in Islamabad, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, also killed 12, leading to tightened security in the capital. Tensions between India and Pakistan remain high, with mutual accusations of backing terrorism. Afghanistan faces a severe humanitarian crisis with widespread hunger and debt, and the Taliban has issued warnings to traders. Elsewhere, Bangladesh is focusing on adapting to rising sea levels, and Nepal's traditional healers were profiled.

# Central Asia

# Russia

Russia's military actions continue, with troops advancing on Ukrainian cities and President Putin threatening to resume nuclear tests and discussing the nation's nuclear response posture. Moscow was also granted compensation by Australia for a canceled embassy project in Canberra. On the domestic front, President Putin met with the CEO of Sberbank.

# West Asia (Middle East)

The conflict in Gaza continues to escalate, with ongoing Israeli attacks, a rising Palestinian death toll, and a severe medical crisis exacerbated by a shortage of syringes, as highlighted by UNICEF. Israeli forces have been accused of killing children, demolishing homes, and using new types of bombs, while settlers have attacked journalists and farmers. In response, Palestinians have protested forced evictions. A ceasefire agreement led to the return of some Palestinian bodies and the remains of an Israeli soldier. Diplomatic efforts are underway, with discussions on a peace deal and meetings between the Pope, the French President, and the Palestinian President. Elsewhere, Iraq held parliamentary elections, Iran is facing water cuts in Tehran due to drought, and Saudi Arabia is granting residency to foreign entrepreneurs.

# Africa

Sudan is in a severe humanitarian and security crisis, with a fragile ceasefire, widespread violence, mass rapes, and civilian kidnappings attributed to the RSF, prompting a UN warning and a growing aid appeal. In West Africa, Mali is facing a fuel crisis and reopening schools, while French nationals have been urged to leave. Nigeria is dealing with internal political and economic turmoil, including a drop in crude revenue, a stock market crash, and escalating warnings of Christian genocide. Across the continent, nations are pursuing development and social change; Rwanda is advancing e-mobility and seeing exports surge, Kenya is showcasing clean energy projects, and South Africa is developing a new vaccine. However, challenges persist, including a resurgence of Somali piracy, landslide risks in Kenya, and diplomatic rifts over persecution claims in Nigeria.

# Europe

The war in Ukraine remains a central focus, with Russian troops advancing and launching drone strikes on cities like Kharkiv. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is calling for more EU sanctions and met with Norway's defense minister, while support for Ukraine is reportedly growing in the US. Tensions are also high between Finland and Russia over border closures, and between Belarus and Lithuania for similar reasons. In domestic politics, France saw a shift with a lawsuit against President Macron and the early release of former President Sarkozy. The UK is experiencing a political and media crisis, with the leadership of the BBC resigning over a documentary controversy and the government facing pressure on multiple fronts. Elsewhere, a Turkish military plane crashed in Georgia, Amsterdam's Central Station was flooded, and Azerbaijan and Armenia showed nascent signs of reconciliation.

# Latin America & Caribbean

The COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, is a major regional event, drawing global attention and protests from indigenous groups who stormed the venue. President Lula addressed the summit with a message of hope, while the conference is tackling initiatives like the Tropical Forever Fund. Politically, Venezuela is conducting military drills amid heightened tensions with the U.S., which has increased its naval presence nearby. Colombia has suspended intelligence sharing with the U.S., and Chile's presidential election campaigns have concluded. Several countries experienced crises, including a train derailment in Argentina that injured 20, a nationwide blackout in the Dominican Republic, and the inauguration of a new president in Bolivia. The IMF has cut Mexico's 2025 growth forecast.

# North America

The United States is grappling with the severe economic and social impacts of a government shutdown, which is costing an estimated $15 billion weekly, causing massive layoffs, and disrupting air travel. A deal to end the impasse has advanced in the Senate. Politically, former President Trump remains a central figure, making promises of tariff dividends, commenting on nuclear testing, and criticizing political opponents. Zohran Mamdani won the NYC mayoral race. The country is also dealing with social issues, including protests against ICE raids, challenges to Supreme Court rulings on LGBTQ rights, and concerns over the federal wealth gap. In Canada, an IDF soldier was accused of assaulting protesters in Toronto, and a joint plan with Mexico is advancing.

# Oceania

In Australia, the government is advancing its quantum technology sector and signed a new security treaty with Indonesia. Domestically, the country is facing debates over its net-zero climate policy, a childcare sector crisis, and rising university fees. Authorities have warned of Black Friday scams and allowed the formation of a neo-Nazi political party. In New Zealand, wildfire efforts are ongoing in Tongariro, ANZ bank posted record profits, and there is a surge of first-home buyers in the property market. The President of Nauru visited the Australian parliament amid controversy.
