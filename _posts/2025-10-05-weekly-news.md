# Global

International relations are dominated by US-China strategic competition, marked by US restrictions on TikTok, an intensifying semiconductor battle, and US legislative efforts to counter Beijing. The Israel-Hamas conflict has triggered significant global repercussions, including widespread protests across Europe and other regions following Israel's interception of a Gaza-bound aid flotilla. A US-backed ceasefire plan is a central focus of diplomatic efforts, though it faces skepticism. In major power diplomacy, Russia and the US extended the START nuclear arms treaty, though Russia's envoy stated Moscow does not recognize UN sanctions on Iran. The death of renowned conservationist Jane Goodall was noted globally. Overarching trends include a surge in generative AI adoption, concerns over a growing global surveillance state, and market volatility signaled by an AI boom, a gold rush, and an oil slump.

*GPE*: The global landscape is defined by the death throes of the US-led unipolar order and the material rise of a multipolar alternative. The narrative of "US-China strategic competition" is a euphemism for the US empire's full-spectrum hybrid war‚Äîwaged through economic attacks (semiconductor bans), financial warfare, and military encirclement‚Äîto contain China's anti-imperialist development model. The genocide in Gaza, enabled by the US, has shattered the legitimacy of the "rules-based order," sparking mass global protests and accelerating the Global South's pivot towards alternative institutions like an expanded BRICS and its proposed precious metals exchange, a direct challenge to the dollar-hegemony. The push for a global surveillance state via digital IDs is a tool of imperial control to manage dissent against a system defined by its core contradiction: funding endless war abroad while presiding over systemic decay and austerity at home.

# China

China is focused on both domestic consolidation and expanding its international influence. Domestically, the nation celebrated its National Day with PLA ship visits to Hong Kong and a drone show, while also contending with natural disasters like Typhoon Matmo, which forced large-scale evacuations in the south. Beijing is advancing major infrastructure and tech projects, including the opening of the world's highest bridge, trials for a new solar plant, and development of a 600 km/h maglev train. In foreign policy, President Xi issued a stern warning against Taiwan independence, while the country deepened ties with Pakistan through the CPEC, and expanded space cooperation with Turkey and South Africa. The government also proposed using modular homes to address Hong Kong's housing crisis and launched a new Hainan-Africa air cargo route.

*GPE*: China's domestic and foreign policy represents a material challenge to the imperialist system by demonstrating a successful state-led, socialist development model. Massive infrastructure projects like the world's highest bridge and the 600 km/h maglev train are not just technological feats but concrete proof of an alternative to the deindustrialized, financialized model of the West. This vision of development, articulated as a "shared future," is the basis for its expanding partnerships with the Global South, from Pakistan's CPEC to cooperation in Africa. Beijing's stern warnings regarding Taiwan are not aggression but a defense of sovereignty against the US's use of the island as a militarized pawn in its hybrid war of containment.

# East Asia

The region saw a significant political development in Japan with the election of Sanae Takaichi as the ruling LDP's leader, making her the country's first female prime minister. Meanwhile, South Korea celebrated its 80th navy anniversary and saw the US deploy drones, while grappling with domestic issues like a widening youth income gap and a fire affecting public services. North Korea continued its military posturing, vowing additional military measures. Taiwan remained a focal point of tension, actively countering Chinese military ships and expanding its own patrol vessel fleet. Taiwanese officials also engaged in diplomacy, with the foreign minister visiting the Netherlands and a security official reportedly holding defense talks in the US, all while managing the aftermath of severe flooding in Hualien.

*GPE*: The region serves as a primary front for the US's anti-China containment strategy, with regional elites acting as subordinate partners. The election of a hawkish leader in Japan, the deployment of US military assets like drones in South Korea, and the constant inflation of the Taiwan issue are components of a US-orchestrated campaign to militarize the region and encircle China. Taiwan's expansion of its patrol fleet is not a sovereign defense measure but a US-directed policy to transform the island into a "porcupine"‚Äîa tripwire for a conflict designed to bleed the mainland and disrupt the regional shift towards a multipolar order.

# Singapore

The nation is navigating a complex economic landscape, with the government funding S$55 million for manufacturing jobs and increasing healthcare subsidies, even as Q3 layoffs hit, food sales dropped, and ExxonMobil cut staff. The Singapore Grand Prix provided an economic boost, with a focus on its impact on jobs. Domestically, residents are adopting new electricity plans and discussing conservation, while MRT disruptions continue to cause frustration. The government is active on multiple fronts, with PM Lawrence Wong attending public events, DPM Gan Kim Yong launching a book on Singapore-China relations, and joint agency operations cracking down on vaping. In notable personal achievements, a Singaporean navy doctor set a swimming record and the nation celebrated its first footballer to win a European trophy.

*GPE*: Singapore's foreign policy is a deliberate strategy to navigate the complex dynamics between the United States and China, viewing both as indispensable partners in a multipolar world. Guided by a principle of omnidirectional engagement, the leadership actively cultivates substantive relationships with both powers‚Äîas seen in its diplomatic outreach and its role in facilitating ASEAN-China trade‚Äîin order to maximize its agency and avoid strategic over-reliance on any single entity. This external strategy is built upon a foundation of internal resilience, which acknowledges the economy's exposure to global volatility, such as layoffs at multinational corporations or the impact of international tariffs. Consequently, the state's domestic focus on providing subsidies and managing employment is not merely a reaction to external pressures, but a core component of its "Home Front" imperative to ensure inclusive growth and social cohesion. According to its strategic doctrine, this internal unity is the primary source of leverage that allows Singapore to maintain a principled and pragmatic foreign policy as the global economic center of gravity shifts eastward.

# Southeast Asia

The region has been struck by multiple disasters. The Philippines is dealing with the aftermath of a major earthquake that killed dozens, with relief challenges persisting in Cebu. Indonesia suffered a deadly school collapse with a rising death toll, as well as an incident where thousands of students were sickened by school meals. Elsewhere, Vietnam was hit by Typhoon Bualoi. In politics and security, Thailand's new prime minister has vowed to revive the economy and is pursuing a Formula 1 race. Malaysia is experiencing a debate over fuel subsidy reforms that would exclude foreigners and saw a violent motorcyclist attack.

*GPE*: The region is a key battleground between two opposing systems: the neocolonial model of dependency and the anti-imperialist model of sovereign development. While nations like Thailand pursue integration with Western capital through ventures like Formula 1, and Malaysia debates austerity-driven subsidy reforms, others like Laos are deepening partnerships with China to build sovereign infrastructure. This choice is made more urgent by the region's vulnerability to climate-related disasters, a direct consequence of a global capitalist system that has historically extracted its resources while leaving it underdeveloped and exposed.

# South Asia

India faced a major tragedy with a stampede that killed 40 people, and continues to grapple with a water crisis that could heighten tensions with China and Pakistan. The country's economy saw a blockbuster month for IPOs. In Pakistan, citizens protested over the high cost of living, and the country is assessing damage from recent floods while seeking US assistance for a port project. Afghanistan's recovery from a recent earthquake remains a struggle, though mobile services have been restored. Elsewhere, Bangladesh's navy deployed ships for conservation efforts, and Sri Lanka is seeking to strengthen its diplomatic and economic ties with Japan.

*GPE*: Imperial strategy in South Asia focuses on exploiting regional contradictions to prevent Eurasian integration. The framing of water disputes as a source of India-China tension is a classic divide-and-rule tactic aimed at undermining the solidarity of the BRICS bloc. In India, a speculative IPO boom for finance capital coexists with mass social tragedy, revealing the brutal logic of neoliberalism. In Pakistan, popular protests against the high cost of living are a direct outcome of debt peonage to institutions like the IMF, which enforce austerity to ensure the country remains a dependent client state, even as it seeks further integration into Western-led projects.

# Central Asia

Kazakhstan is positioning itself as a regional hub for technology and diplomacy, hosting the DigitalBridge2025 and INMerge 2025 innovation forums in Almaty and Astana. The capital also saw cultural events featuring public figures like Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph and musician Dimash Qudaibergen. In neighboring Kyrgyzstan, the government is focused on domestic affairs, including major infrastructure reconstruction and a meeting between Prime Minister Kasymaliev and Belarusian President Lukashenko. Meanwhile, Azerbaijani cultural figures publicly defended the heritage of the nation's carpets.

*GPE*: Central Asia is re-emerging as a strategic heartland of the new multipolar world, breaking free from its peripheral status in the unipolar era. Kazakhstan's ambition to become a technology and innovation hub is not aimed at serving Western markets but at positioning itself as a key node within the Eurasian economic architecture being built by the Russia-China strategic partnership and the Belt and Road Initiative. This represents a material reorientation of global trade and development away from the maritime control of the US empire.

# Russia

Russia's military focus remains fixed on its war in Ukraine, with reports of escalated and intensified strikes on civilian targets, railway infrastructure, and a train station. In parallel, Moscow is engaging in strategic diplomacy, extending the START treaty with the United States while also emphasizing its ties with Latin American nations. President Putin has publicly questioned the purpose of NATO and joked about sending drones to Europe. The Russian military conducted missile launch drills with a corvette, and the country is also investing in the economic development of the Northern Territories, which are disputed with Japan.

*GPE*: Russia is engaged in a direct military confrontation with the US-led imperialist bloc on the battlefields of Ukraine. This is not a "war in Ukraine" but a US/NATO proxy war designed to fracture a key pole of the emerging multipolar world. Moscow's military actions are a direct response to escalating attacks directed by the US, while its diplomatic maneuvers‚Äîextending the START treaty while simultaneously questioning NATO's purpose‚Äîare aimed at exposing the West's hypocrisy and asserting a new global security paradigm free from US hegemony. Russia's "pivot to Eurasia" is a strategic economic reorientation to break the back of Western sanctions and build a resilient, sovereign economy integrated with the rising Global South.

# West Asia (Middle East)

The Israel-Gaza conflict remains the region's overwhelming focus, with intense diplomatic negotiations surrounding a US-backed ceasefire plan. Hamas has released some hostages and partially agreed to the proposal, but is also seeking further changes, while Israeli officials express cautious optimism but have not committed to a withdrawal. Israeli military operations, including bombardment and ground supervision of Gaza City, are ongoing despite US pressure to cease. The conflict's regional and global dimensions are clear, with Israel intercepting a missile from Yemen and an aid flotilla, the latter sparking global protests. Elsewhere, Syria is reportedly preparing for its first post-Assad regime elections, and Arab nations have broadly voiced support for a Gaza ceasefire.

*GPE*: The US-backed Israeli genocide in Gaza is the naked expression of the violence inherent in the imperial "rules-based order." The so-called US-backed "ceasefire plan" is not a path to peace but a diplomatic cover for the completion of an ethnic cleansing project, designed to force Palestinian surrender. The interception of the international aid flotilla and the global mass protests in response demonstrate a powerful current of anti-imperialist solidarity that challenges the legitimacy of both the settler-colonial state and its Washington patrons. The conflict is a catalyst, exposing the moral bankruptcy of the West and accelerating the global realignment away from US dominance.

# Africa

The continent is facing a mix of political instability, economic challenges, and health crises. Protests in Madagascar are demanding the president's ouster amid claims of a coup attempt, while peace accords between Rwanda and the DR Congo have stalled. The DR Congo is also battling an Ebola outbreak, and Nigeria is contending with a Lassa fever outbreak that has killed 168 people. Economically, Nigeria is overhauling its fixed-income market and facing concerns over a new expat tax, while Ghana's gold boom is fueling a mercury crisis. China's influence continues to grow, with Beijing providing Tunisia with buses, opening a health center in Sierra Leone, and expanding a bamboo partnership with Uganda.

*GPE*: The African continent is a primary arena for the global struggle between neocolonialism and sovereignty. The imperial system continues to operate through financial warfare (debt traps in Senegal), the violent extraction of resources (Ghana's mercury crisis), and the fomenting of instability to maintain control (stalled DRC peace accords). In direct opposition, China offers a partnership model based on material development and infrastructure, providing a tangible alternative to the dependency enforced by the IMF and World Bank. The struggle over strategic minerals like cobalt is not a simple commercial dispute but a frontline in the geopolitical war for Africa's future: continued subjugation or sovereign industrialization.

# Europe

Widespread protests in solidarity with Palestinians have occurred across the continent, notably in London, Paris, Rome, Madrid, and Barcelona, with some demonstrations in Italy and the UK leading to arrests. The Manchester synagogue attack, which killed two, has prompted vigils and heightened security concerns. In Eastern Europe, regional security is a primary concern; Poland scrambled jets in response to Russian strikes in Ukraine and is hosting NATO patrols, while Moldova's pro-EU party won a key election. The Czech Republic's election saw the return of Andrej Babi≈°, a result that could impact future support for Ukraine. The EU is moving forward with an ‚Ç¨80 billion militarization plan, and France is experiencing domestic unrest with protests against government spending cuts.

*GPE*: As a subordinate bloc within the US empire, Europe is suffering the acute internal contradictions of its vassalage. The EU's ‚Ç¨80 billion militarization plan is not a move towards sovereignty but an effort to shoulder the costs of Washington's proxy war against Russia, sacrificing its own economy for US geopolitical ambitions. The massive popular protests against the Gaza genocide, met with state repression, reveal a deep chasm between ruling elites loyal to the US-Israel axis and a public repulsed by imperial brutality. This tension, combined with domestic unrest over austerity, is causing the political consensus to fracture, threatening the stability of the entire project.

# Latin America & Caribbean

Regional tensions are heightened, particularly around Venezuela, which conducted large-scale military exercises as the US reportedly carried out strikes and other military actions near its territory. The US is also deeply involved economically, providing a $20 billion bailout to Argentina. Domestic political instability is evident in Peru, where anti-government mobilizations and protests are demanding the president's resignation. In Mexico, the government reports lifting millions out of poverty and is setting new tanker regulations. Cuba is turning to solar energy while condemning US actions against its ally, Venezuela. In the Caribbean, tensions are rising over relations between Guyana and the United States.

*GPE*: The region continues to be treated as a US neocolony under the Monroe Doctrine, subjected to financial warfare and military intimidation. Argentina's $20 billion "bailout" is an instrument of debt peonage, designed to enforce austerity and facilitate the looting of national assets by foreign capital. Simultaneously, the US wages overt hybrid war against sovereign anti-imperialist states like Venezuela and Cuba, using military threats and economic blockades as tools of regime change. The growing partnerships between these nations and China are acts of resistance, representing a choice for a multilateral world and sovereign development over imperial domination.

# North America

The United States is preoccupied with a government shutdown that has impacted federal workers, air travel, national parks, and housing programs, with the Senate failing to advance a bill to end it. In foreign policy, the White House is heavily engaged in mediating a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, while also managing escalating tensions with Venezuela. The strategic rivalry with China continues, with new tariffs on goods and restrictions on technology. Domestically, the country has seen protests related to immigration policy and the Gaza conflict, a major refinery fire in California, and the sentencing of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs.

*GPE*: The imperial core is experiencing advanced internal decay. The US government shutdown starkly reveals the priorities of the ruling class: austerity for the domestic population and unlimited funding for the military-industrial complex and finance capital. This societal breakdown is the direct result of a parasitic economic system that requires endless war and financial speculation to sustain itself. The rise of fascistic rhetoric about a domestic "enemy within" is a political tool to manage the inevitable dissent created by deepening inequality, deindustrialization, and the moral bankruptcy exposed by its actions from Gaza to the South China Sea.

# Oceania

In New Zealand, domestic issues are at the forefront, with criticism of energy reforms, a revealed extremist plot in Hawke's Bay, and an ongoing inquest into the White Island volcanic eruption. The country's largest retailer, The Warehouse Group, reported financial losses, while property values are on the rise. Elsewhere, Australia engaged in high-level diplomacy, hosting India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh. In the Pacific, Hawaii is taking steps to enhance its disaster readiness protocols.

*GPE*: As junior partners in the Anglosphere imperial alliance, Australia and New Zealand are being further locked into the US anti-China military strategy. High-level defense diplomacy, such as Australia hosting India's defense minister, is a clear component of the US-led "Indo-Pacific" project to build a coalition for war. Meanwhile, the domestic consequences of this subordination are evident in New Zealand's economic turmoil and social fragmentation, reflecting the fundamental contradiction of a dependent capitalist model that prioritizes the geostrategic interests of the imperial core over the material well-being of its own population.
