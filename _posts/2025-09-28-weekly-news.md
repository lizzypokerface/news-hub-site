# Global

*Overview*: Leaders convened for the UN General Assembly to discuss peace, justice, multilateralism, and global division, with climate change and sustainable development being dominant themes. China pledged emissions cuts and criticized US tariffs, while the US-EU trade deal failed. The global financial system showed signs of strain with China's push for de-dollarization, volatile markets, rising gold prices, and concerns over cyber threats and trade frictions. In international security, 187 nations supported a nuclear test ban treaty, while a G20 deal targeted hunger and the global south sought financial sovereignty. The escalating Israel-Gaza conflict prompted worldwide protests and the UN blacklisting of some companies for Palestinian rights violations. Other developments included a UN summit on AI governance, a fusion energy breakthrough, and the release of the Epstein files implicating global figures.

*Analysis*: The UN General Assembly serves not as a forum for multilateral cooperation, but as a key battleground in the struggle between the decaying US-led unipolar system and the ascendant multipolar order. [[1]](https://mackinderforum.org/articles/a-fractured-world-order-faces-the-un-why-the-2025-general-assembly-matters)[[2]](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/un-general-assembly-what-happens/) While China and the Global South advocate for multilateralism and financial sovereignty, the US attempts to preserve its dominance through financial warfare and by blocking peace initiatives, such as the six UN resolutions for a ceasefire in Gaza it has vetoed. [[3]](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2025/09/22/israel-genocide-gaza-un-us-veto/) The systemic shift is most evident in the accelerating de-dollarization campaign, with the expanded BRICS bloc developing alternative financial systems and increasing gold reserves to break free from US neocolonial control, rendering institutions of the old order, like the UN itself, increasingly irrelevant.

# China

*Overview*: China engaged in significant diplomatic activity, with Premier Li Qiang addressing the UN General Assembly on multilateralism and warning against global division. The government responded to a US order concerning TikTok, sought the removal of tariffs on soy, and strengthened relations with Belarus, including discussions on nuclear ambitions. Domestically, President Xi Jinping visited Xinjiang, with state media highlighting the region's development, cultural heritage, and advancements in agriculture, such as seawater rice. The nation launched the Fengyun-3 08 satellite, showcased industrial and humanoid robot technology, and achieved a historic pig lung transplant. However, the country also faced economic alarms from a supply glut, struggles in its factories due to US tariffs, and a job crunch. Super 

*Analysis*: China‚Äôs diplomatic and domestic policies represent a coherent anti-imperialist strategy of sovereign development. At the UN, its call for multilateralism is a direct challenge to the US "rules-based order," while its resistance to US tariffs and tech bans exposes the economic war being waged to contain its rise. [[6]](https://asiatimes.com/2025/04/us-china-trade-war-economic-fallout-and-strategic-realignment/) The Western narrative of "forced labor" in Xinjiang is a propaganda tool designed to disrupt this development and undermine China's stability; in reality, state-led investment in the region is a successful poverty alleviation and de-radicalization program. [[7]](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202401/17/WS65a747bba3105f21a507cc4a.html)[[8]](https://johnmenadue.com/post/2024/12/western-media-an-echo-chamber-for-the-us-uighur-genocide-narrative/) Meanwhile, technological and military advancements, such as in satellite technology and aircraft carriers, demonstrate China's successful industrial policy and growing capacity to defend its sovereignty against US imperial pressure.

# East Asia

*Overview*: In Japan, the ruling LDP leadership race focused on cost-of-living issues and other policy debates. The country's shipbuilders are aiming for a green comeback. In South Korea, the government is toughening its stance on dating violence, and the nation experienced a series of domestic disruptions, including the crash of government IT systems and a fire causing a Kakao service outage. A battery cell CEO was sentenced over a deadly fire, and US H-1B visa fee hikes have shocked Korean students. North Korea reaffirmed its nuclear stance while its leader, Kim Jong-un, hinted at a potential meeting with the US President but criticized South Korea. In Taiwan, recovery from floods in Hualien and Super Typhoon Ragasa is underway. The island's allies voiced support for it at the UN, and Taipei confirmed anti-dumping levies on Chinese goods, while the US banned imports from a Taiwanese bike company over forced labor claims.

*Analysis*: This region is a primary front for the US imperial strategy of containing China, with nations like Japan and South Korea acting as subordinate client states. Their domestic policy debates are secondary to their integration into Washington's military and economic encirclement of Beijing. Taiwan is instrumentalized as a key geopolitical pawn, with its international "support" coming from other US dependencies, serving as a pretext for US military posturing and anti-China sanctions. North Korea's nuclear program is a rational and necessary deterrent developed in response to decades of existential threats from the United States.

# Singapore

*Overview*: The government addressed numerous domestic issues in Parliament, with Prime Minister Wong discussing worker protection and the President's Speech, and other ministers debating the role of the Leader of the Opposition and the cost of living. Authorities are tackling public safety and social concerns, including a fatal knife attack in Yishun, a suspicious package incident at a mosque, fire hazards, and a rat infestation. The nation celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival, while PM Wong urged youth to defy negative social trends. On the economic front, the SGX launched a new mid-cap index, an SGD-backed stablecoin is set to launch, and debates were held on COE prices and retail property concerns. In foreign affairs, Singapore urged UN reform and expressed hope for a ceasefire in Gaza.

*Analysis*: Singapore functions as a critical financial and logistical hub for global capital in Asia, a role it secures not by mortgaging its sovereignty, but through a pragmatic foreign policy of hedging. This strategy involves maintaining a deep security partnership with the U.S. as a provider of regional stability while simultaneously cultivating its relationship with China as its top economic partner, all to preserve its own independence. Its diplomatic calls for UN reform and a ceasefire in Gaza are carefully calibrated actions consistent with its foundational principle of upholding a rules-based international order, which it views as essential for the survival of small states. These positions reinforce its neutrality, allowing it to act as a trusted broker between major powers and the Global South. Internally, parliamentary debates over the cost of living and worker protection reflect the inherent contradictions of its economic model, which prioritizes attracting international capital, creating tensions with the goal of ensuring the material well-being of its domestic labor force.

# Southeast Asia

*Overview*: The region was hit by Super Typhoon Ragasa, which impacted the Philippines, where farmers are also struggling with rice imports and anti-corruption protests have turned violent. In Thailand, the Prime Minister is set to dissolve parliament, while a large sinkhole collapsed a road in Bangkok. Indonesia signed an economic partnership with Canada, though some Indonesian Muslims expressed hesitation over vaccines due to halal concerns, and a subsidiary of Wilmar was convicted. Elsewhere, the death of a journalist in Myanmar was revealed. At a regional level, ASEAN ministers met to focus on trade.

*Analysis*: The region is an arena of intensifying conflict between US-led neocolonial hybrid warfare and the drive for sovereign development. Anti-corruption protests and unrest in the Philippines are framed as US-funded destabilization campaigns aimed at maintaining the country's dependency and undermining any pivot toward China. Regional efforts by ASEAN to deepen trade and economic integration represent an attempt to navigate the pressures of the new cold war, as nations are courted by both the US imperial bloc and the alternative development models offered by the China-led multipolar world.

# South Asia

*Overview*: Tensions between India and Pakistan were prominent at the UN General Assembly, where India's External Affairs Minister condemned Pakistan. Domestically, India faced several tragedies, including stampedes at a political rally and a festival in Tamil Nadu that killed dozens. The government also cut a consumption tax, and protests in Ladakh resulted in casualties. In Afghanistan, the Taliban rejected any potential US return to the country, including a proposal to use Bagram airbase, and stated its focus is on economic recovery. An illegal migrant route from India to the United States was also exposed.

*Analysis*: The region exemplifies the contradictions of the global realignment, as nations are caught between US imperial demands and the material benefits of multipolar integration. India is a key example, simultaneously participating in the US-led anti-China alliance while pursuing its economic interests within BRICS+ alongside Russia and China. [[9]](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/01/economists-radhika-desai-michael-hudson-explain-multipolarity-decline-of-us-hegemony.html) Domestic crises, such as protests by farmers, are the direct result of neocolonial policies imposed by Western financial institutions like the IMF. [[10]](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2025/08/06/world-us-financial-colonialism-economist-michael-hudson/) The Taliban's definitive rejection of any US military return to Afghanistan marks the final failure of the two-decade imperial occupation and a victory for national sovereignty.

# Central Asia

*Overview*: Leaders from the region took the stage at the UN General Assembly in New York. Kazakhstan's President Tokayev met with American executives and used his UN address to call for serious global conversation and highlight his country's stance on nuclear power and non-proliferation. Kyrgyzstan's President Japarov also spoke at the UN and met with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, while at home, the country's parliament dissolved itself and a top official reportedly uncovered a major smuggling operation.

*Analysis*: Central Asian nations are leveraging their geostrategic position at the heart of Eurasia to assert greater sovereignty and navigate the transition to a multipolar world. [[11]](https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/united-nations-un-80-relevant-unga) Leaders use forums like the UNGA to court capital from all sides, exemplified by Kazakhstan's engagement with US executives while remaining a cornerstone of China's Belt and Road Initiative. This balancing act demonstrates a clear move away from unipolar dependency. Internal political instability, such as in Kyrgyzstan, is a primary vector for hybrid warfare campaigns by external powers seeking to disrupt regional integration projects and control vital resource and transit corridors.

* [`T-House` A taste of eternity on the Silk Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm1CpDR4VNQ)

# Russia

*Overview*: Russia's diplomatic and military activities were a focus of global attention. Foreign Minister Lavrov addressed the UN General Assembly and criticized what he termed US militarization near Venezuela. The military was active in Europe, with German Eurofighters intercepting a Russian plane and the Polish Foreign Minister issuing a warning over airspace violations. The ongoing war in Ukraine has reportedly crippled the country's oil production. Moscow also warned it would respond to any aggression, and President Putin made strong statements regarding nuclear dialogue. The mystery surrounding the Nord Stream pipeline persists, and in a domestic incident, polar bears occupied a remote Russian research station.

*Analysis*: Russia stands as a primary pole in the global anti-imperialist alliance, and consequently, a principal target of US-NATO aggression. The war in Ukraine is not a localized dispute but a US proxy war, designed to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, subordinate Europe, and preserve unipolar hegemony. [[1]](https://mackinderforum.org/articles/a-fractured-world-order-faces-the-un-why-the-2025-general-assembly-matters) The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline and attempts to cripple its oil industry are acts of economic warfare. In response, Russia has accelerated its pivot away from the West, deepening its strategic and economic integration with China and the Global South to construct a viable alternative to the US-dominated imperial system.


# West Asia (Middle East)

*Overview*: The conflict between Israel and Palestine dramatically intensified, with heavy bombing in Gaza killing dozens, disastrous humanitarian aid conditions, and a flotilla carrying aid facing drone attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu faced global pressure, protests, and walkouts during his UN speech, where he also addressed the issue of Israeli hostages. The conflict sparked worldwide protests, and the UN blacklisted some companies over Palestinian rights violations. Tensions also rose between the US and Turkey over Russia. The US reimposed sanctions on Iran, which faced escalation threats from the UK, France, and Germany. Elsewhere, a pact described as an "Arab NATO" was signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, Syrian children were reportedly stolen, Iraq resumed oil exports to Turkey, and Hezbollah commemorated a former leader.

*Analysis*: The region is the site of a brutal US-backed settler-colonial project, with Israel functioning as an armed outpost of American empire. [[12]](https://annd.org/en/publications/details/the-future-of-gaza-in-a-geopolitical-context-sari-hanafi)[[13]](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/israel-palestine-conflict/) The assault on Gaza is not a "conflict" but a genocide, as stated by UN experts, aimed at the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians to seize land and resources. [[3]](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2025/09/22/israel-genocide-gaza-un-us-veto/) The US provides the material and diplomatic cover for this genocide, repeatedly vetoing peace resolutions at the UN. [[3]](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2025/09/22/israel-genocide-gaza-un-us-veto/) The formation of pacts like the "Arab NATO" and growing tensions between the US and its client states like Turkey and Saudi Arabia reveal deep fractures in the imperial coalition, as regional powers begin to pursue their own interests in a fragmenting world order.

# Africa

*Overview*: The continent faced significant humanitarian and political challenges. The UN warned of a severe crisis in Sudan due to the ongoing civil war, while conflict in the DR Congo has led to increased demand for prosthetic limbs. In Nigeria, the government is tackling insecurity, development challenges, and corruption, with the national anti-corruption agency graduating new cadets and a major refinery being hit by a strike. Political developments included Guinea voting on a new constitution, clashes erupting in Uganda, and Madagascar imposing a curfew amid protests. Egypt defended its military presence in the Sinai Peninsula, and a prominent activist was freed from prison. Regionally, African nations are seeking permanent seats on the UN Security Council, and the G20 struck a deal to combat hunger.

*Analysis*: Africa is a central battleground in the global struggle between neocolonial exploitation and anti-imperialist liberation. [[15]](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202408/1317338.shtml) Ongoing conflicts in nations like Sudan and the DR Congo are fueled by the competition between foreign powers for control over the continent's vast mineral wealth. In stark contrast, the successful expulsion of French and US military forces from the Sahel by countries like Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso marks a historic advance for sovereignty. China's role is transformative, offering a development model based on infrastructure investment and industrial partnership that directly challenges the centuries-old Western model of raw material extraction and debt dependency.

# Europe

*Overview*: The European Union faced internal pressures from potential debt defaults and a budget crisis in France, while its foreign policy was marked by the failure of a trade deal with the US. The continent is heavily involved in the Ukraine conflict, with NATO testing new security measures and member states like the UK and Germany providing military support. Poland's relationship with Ukraine became strained after it announced a cut in refugee aid. Tensions with Russia remained high, with NATO jets intercepting a Russian aircraft and Moldova conducting raids related to Russian meddling. Domestically, former French President Sarkozy was jailed for corruption, the UK is set to mandate digital ID cards, and protests against the Gaza war were held in Berlin.

*Analysis*: Europe is a subordinate bloc of the US empire, suffering from a collective "Stockholm Syndrome" that compels it to sacrifice its own economic and security interests to serve Washington's agenda. [[16]](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/214623/economics/europes-economic-decline-how-the-eu-fell-behind-us/)[[17]](https://www.futuribles.com/en/sur-le-decrochage-economique-europe-etats-unis/) Its deindustrialization and economic decline are self-inflicted wounds, direct results of participating in the US proxy war against Russia and the economic war against China. [[16]](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/214623/economics/europes-economic-decline-how-the-eu-fell-behind-us/)[[18]](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/127602/The%20Decline%20of%20Europe%20and%20the%20US%20-%20Shifts%20in%20the%20World%20Economy%20and%20in%20Global%20Politics.pdf) The failure of the US-EU trade deal, coupled with internal debt and budget crises, exposes Europe's collapsing material base, while the imposition of policies like digital ID cards signifies a move toward "techno-feudalism" as a means of social control by a decadent and increasingly desperate ruling class.

# Latin America & Caribbean

*Overview*: Tensions escalated around Venezuela, with the US sending warships to the region and President Maduro supporting national defense drills, drawing criticism from Russia's Foreign Minister. Argentina is facing economic chaos and a potential bailout. Protests were repressed in Peru. Cuba's government denounced the "genocide" of Palestinians and voiced support for China's global initiatives. Across the region, there is a growing focus on the economy and the implementation of artificial intelligence.

*Analysis*: The region continues to be a primary site of resistance to the US imperial project, historically defined by the Monroe Doctrine. [[19]](https://viewpointmag.com/2018/02/01/nuestra-america-abya-yala-notes-imperialism-anti-imperialism-latin-america-across-centuries/) The deployment of US warships to Venezuela is an act of 21st-century gunboat diplomacy, aimed at overthrowing its sovereign anti-imperialist government to seize the world's largest oil reserves. [[20]](https://dissidentvoice.org/2025/09/u-s-domestic-colonial-occupation-must-be-met-with-a-struggle-for-decolonization-not-reform/)[[21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9uKtxS7Ssc) Argentina's economic chaos is a textbook case of debt peonage, engineered through financial warfare by the IMF to facilitate asset stripping by foreign capital. [[22]](https://profmoosa.com/how-the-world-can-free-itself-from-us-financial-colonialism-economist-michael-hudson-explains/) The consistent anti-imperialist stance of nations like Cuba, which denounces the genocide in Palestine and supports China's global initiatives, highlights the region's crucial role in the construction of a multipolar world free from US domination.

# North America

*Overview*: In the United States, the economy showed signs of distress, with the Federal Reserve signaling aggressive rate cuts and concerns rising over a credit market meltdown. The government faced a potential shutdown leading to job cuts. Politically, former FBI Director James Comey was indicted, and the President faced criticism for expanding a crackdown on free speech and for his administration's response to protests and natural disasters, including hurricanes on the east coast and wildfires in California. In foreign policy, the administration sent warships to Venezuela, signed an order for the sale of TikTok, engaged in a trade dispute with China, and was involved in negotiations for a deal related to Gaza. Canada's primary mention was the signing of an economic pact with Indonesia.

*Analysis*: The United States, the imperial core, is exhibiting advanced symptoms of systemic decay. Its financialized economy is teetering on the brink of collapse, evidenced by looming credit market meltdowns, emergency Federal Reserve actions, and the threat of government shutdowns, all of which reveal the unsustainability of an order built on debt and deindustrialization. [[24]](https://michael-hudson.com/2025/06/the-strategic-empire-debt-the-dollar/) As the empire loses its grip on global hegemony, it turns its instruments of repression inward. The expansion of state surveillance, the indictment of political opponents, and the official crackdown on free speech are the hallmarks of a declining power resorting to "American Style Fascism" to manage escalating domestic contradictions and dissent.

# Oceania

*Overview*: Australia was in the spotlight as the Australian company Optus, owned by Singapore's Singtel, was fined for a major service outage. There was also a lifestyle report of an Australian family choosing to relocate to Singapore over London. In the Pacific Islands, a cultural note mentioned that traditional Japanese musical instruments resonated with audiences in Fiji.

*Analysis*: Australia operates as a junior partner within the US-led imperial system, functioning primarily as a forward base for military and intelligence operations aimed at containing China in the Indo-Pacific. Its domestic political and economic concerns are subordinate to this strategic alignment with Washington. The presence of Australian citizens, such as doctors working in Gaza, on the front lines of imperial violence creates a stark contradiction between the government's official pro-imperialist policy and the grim reality witnessed by its people, exposing the human cost of its geopolitical subservience.
