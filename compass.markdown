# Geopolitical Economy

*An Analytical Framework for Seeing the World as It Is*

> The world is not chaos. It is a system of conflict between domination and the struggle for sovereignty—between imperialism and development. This framework reveals the hidden material forces that shape events, cutting through ideology to expose the real stakes of our time.

## The Three Core Principles

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unity** | Politics and economics are inseparable—two aspects of a single field of conflict. The "economy" is not a neutral, natural system; it is a site of power and struggle. |
| **Conflict** | The engine of modern history is the dialectic between imperialist domination and anti-imperialist resistance. This is not ideology—it is the material structure of the world system. |
| **Action** | Imperialism is a necessity for capitalism's survival. Sovereign development—the developmental state—is the primary form of resistance. The key actors are classes and nations, not individuals. |

## The Two Forces

### Imperialism

A system, not an attitude. The necessary process by which advanced capitalist states manage internal contradictions (falling profits, class conflict) by dominating other territories—through debt, coercion, and "free market" rules that benefit the core.

### Anti-Imperialism

The material struggle for development and sovereignty. Its ultimate expression is the **developmental state** : using protectionism, state planning, and industrial policy to build sovereign productive capacity. This is how the US, Germany, Japan, and China rose.

## The Method: Critique of Political Economy

Looks *through* the seemingly neutral "things" of the economy (commodity, wage, debt, "impact") to reveal the **hidden social relations** within them. Every economic category conceals a power relation. The task is to unmask it. Ask: What kind of society produces this category? Whose interests does it serve? What exploitation does it obscure?

## The Five Analytical Questions

1. **Cui Bono?** — Who benefits materially? Look past rhetoric. Which corporations, banks, states, or class fractions gain?

2. **What contradiction is being solved?** — Is a war providing markets? Is a crisis forcing privatization? Is a deal offloading surplus?

3. **Follow the debt.** — Who owes whom, in what currency? Dollar-denominated debt is imperial control. Sovereignty requires monetary autonomy.

4. **Imperialism or anti-imperialism?** — Does the policy open a country for extraction, or protect domestic productive capacity?

5. **What is the gap between rhetoric and reality?** — Compare what leaders say ("democracy," "humanitarian," "value," "impact") with material outcomes (resource control, rival weakening, surplus extraction).

## Levels of Analysis

| Level | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Macro** | The world system: imperialism, financialization, hegemonic struggle |
| **Meso** | Nations & institutions: developmental states, debt regimes, policy |
| **Micro** | Individual experience: shaped by structural forces, not random |

The framework maps the currents. Individual experience is where they manifest.

> Clarity is the antidote to disorientation. Understanding is the first step toward agency.
